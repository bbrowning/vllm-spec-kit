# Feature Specification: Mistral Tokenizer Async Event Loop Fix

**Feature Branch**: `20251002-mistral-tokenizer-async`
**Created**: 2025-10-02
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "I need to solve the vllm bug described at https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/24910 where requests with large payloads that use the Mistral Tokenizers are blocking the async event loop. Read that github issue description and its comments, as there are important details from Ben Browning there about what is happening. I need to first write a failing test that confirms the mistral tokenizer is blockin the event loop, fix the event loop block by some strategy to get the blocking code off the event loop (perhaps a new asyncio thread), and then confirm the test passes. Focus just on fixing this for the mixtral tokenizer path, as the hugging face tokenizers path is already async and does not block the loop."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-02
- Q: When multiple large payload requests (each 400KB+) are submitted concurrently to the Mistral tokenizer, what should the system behavior be? ‚Üí A: Queue them sequentially in background threads/processes (one at a time) to limit resource usage
- Q: What should happen when an extremely large payload (multi-MB, beyond typical usage) is submitted for Mistral tokenization? ‚Üí A: Same behavior as current system (no special handling for size)
- Q: When tokenization encounters an error during async processing (e.g., invalid input, out-of-memory), how should the error be reported to the caller? ‚Üí A: Return same error format as current synchronous implementation (preserve existing error behavior)
- Q: What specific observability signals (logs, metrics, traces) should be added for the async tokenization operations? ‚Üí A: No new observability (maintain same logging/metrics as current implementation)
- Q: The performance requirement states tokenization preprocessing time must remain "comparable" to the current implementation. What is the acceptable performance overhead? ‚Üí A: No measurable overhead (within 5% of current performance)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a vLLM service operator, when users submit large payload requests (especially with Mistral tokenizers), the service must continue to respond to health checks and other concurrent requests without blocking. Currently, a 439KB request can take up to 53 seconds to preprocess, during which the `/health` endpoint becomes unresponsive, causing Kubernetes liveness probes to fail and terminate the pod.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a vLLM service using Mistral tokenizer is running, **When** a large payload request (e.g., 439KB) is submitted for tokenization, **Then** concurrent requests to the `/health` endpoint must respond within acceptable timeframes (under 2 seconds)
2. **Given** a vLLM service is processing a large Mistral tokenizer request, **When** multiple other requests are submitted concurrently, **Then** those requests must be processed without significant delay or blocking
3. **Given** the tokenization preprocessing completes, **When** the tokenization result is returned, **Then** the result must be correct and identical to the blocking implementation

### Edge Cases
- Multiple large payload requests submitted concurrently are queued and processed sequentially (one at a time) to prevent resource exhaustion
- Extremely large payloads (multi-MB requests) are processed with the same behavior as the current system (no special size limits or handling)
- Tokenization errors during async processing are reported using the same error format as the current synchronous implementation

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST process Mistral tokenizer requests without blocking the async event loop
- **FR-002**: System MUST maintain health endpoint responsiveness (under 2 seconds) during large payload tokenization
- **FR-003**: System MUST produce identical tokenization results compared to the current blocking implementation
- **FR-004**: System MUST handle errors during async tokenization and report them using the same error format as the current synchronous implementation
- **FR-005**: System MUST queue concurrent large payload requests and process them sequentially (one at a time) to limit resource usage
- **FR-006**: Testing infrastructure MUST be able to detect and verify event loop blocking behavior
- **FR-007**: System MUST only fix the Mistral tokenizer path, leaving HuggingFace tokenizer path unchanged
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain the same logging and metrics behavior as the current implementation (no new observability signals)

### Performance Requirements
- **PR-001**: Health endpoint MUST respond within 2 seconds during concurrent large payload processing
- **PR-002**: Large payload requests (up to 1MB) MUST complete preprocessing without blocking other requests
- **PR-003**: Tokenization preprocessing time MUST remain within 5% of current implementation performance (no measurable overhead)

### Key Entities
- **Tokenization Request**: A request containing text payload that needs to be tokenized using Mistral tokenizer
- **Health Check Request**: A concurrent request to the `/health` endpoint that monitors service availability
- **Async Event Loop**: The execution context that must remain responsive while processing tokenization requests
