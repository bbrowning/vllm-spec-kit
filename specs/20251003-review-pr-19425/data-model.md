### 6. FileType

Enumeration of file types in the subsystem.

**Values**:

- `pytest_markers_used`: List[String] - Markers like `core_model`, `slow_test`
- `coverage_assessment`: String - Critical/Adequate/Insufficient

**Validation Rules**:
- If critical_paths_covered is False, coverage_assessment must be "Insufficient"
- missing_coverage items should map to Finding entities if critical

### 8. PRComment

A reviewer comment or discussion from the PR.

**Attributes**:
- `comment_id`: String - GitHub comment ID or sequential number

  │
  └── Finding
        ├── references FileAnalysis (via location/evidence)
        ├── may be generated by PRComment
        └── may reference StreamingEdgeCase or TokenizerVersion

FileAnalysis
  ├── has TestCoverage
  ├── references other FileAnalysis (via dependencies)
  └── referenced by Finding

PRComment
  └── may generate Finding (CommentResolution category)

## Validation Summary

**Critical Validations**:
1. All Critical/High severity findings must have actionable recommendations
2. All PRComment entities where addressed_in_pr=False and has_documented_rationale=False must generate CommentResolution findings
3. All StreamingEdgeCase entities where is_tested=False and severity_if_unhandled=Critical/High must generate findings
4. All three TokenizerVersion entities must have has_test_coverage=True or generate findings
5. ReviewFindings.findings_by_category must include all five categories

**Data Integrity Rules**:
1. Finding.finding_id must be unique across all findings
2. FileAnalysis.file_path must be valid repository paths
3. All cross-references (finding_id, related_finding_id) must point to existing entities
4. Severity levels must align with category constraints

## Usage in Review Process

1. **Discovery Phase**: Create FileAnalysis for all subsystem files
2. **PR Analysis**: Create PRComment entities from GitHub discussions
3. **Test Analysis**: Populate TestCoverage, TokenizerVersion, StreamingEdgeCase entities
4. **Finding Generation**: Create Finding entities based on validation rules
5. **Organization**: Populate ReviewFindings with categorized findings
6. **Reporting**: Generate detailed analysis document from ReviewFindings structure

This data model ensures systematic, comprehensive review with clear traceability from observations to findings to recommendations.
