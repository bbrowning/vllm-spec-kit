## SI-001: ijson Dependency May Not Be in Requirements

**Severity**: MEDIUM

**Title**: New ijson dependency may not be declared in vLLM requirements.txt

**Description**:
PR #19425 adds `ijson` as a new dependency for pre-v11 tokenizer streaming parsing. While the code imports and uses ijson, it's unclear whether ijson is declared in vLLM's requirements.txt or pyproject.toml. Missing dependency declaration would cause deployment failures.

**Location**:
- Import: `/Volumes/SourceCode/vllm/trees/20251003-review-pr-19425/vllm/entrypoints/openai/tool_parsers/mistral_tool_parser.py:11`
- Usage: Lines 92-93, 334, 445
- Dependency file: Needs verification in requirements.txt

**Evidence**:
```python
# Line 11
import ijson

# Line 92-93
self.parse_coro = ijson.parse_coro(
    self.update_stream_state_pre_v11_tokenizer())

# Line 334
@ijson.coroutine
def update_stream_state_pre_v11_tokenizer(self):
```

From integration-analysis.md:
- ijson identified as new external dependency
- Status: NEEDS VERIFICATION
- Risk: MEDIUM (deployment failures if missing)

**Impact**:
- ImportError at runtime if ijson not installed
- Deployment failures in production environments
- Docker builds fail if ijson not in requirements
- Users installing from source encounter missing dependency

**Recommendation**:

**Immediate Action** (before merge):
1. Verify ijson in requirements.txt or pyproject.toml:
   ```bash
   grep -r "ijson" requirements*.txt pyproject.toml
   ```

2. If missing, add to appropriate requirements file:
   ```
   # In requirements-common.txt or equivalent
   ijson>=3.2.0  # Adjust version as needed
   ```

3. Document minimum ijson version if specific features required

4. Update CI/CD to test with fresh dependency install

**Verification**:
- Run `pip install -e .` in clean virtualenv
- Verify import succeeds: `python -c "import ijson"`
- Run tests with clean environment

**Priority**: MEDIUM (must fix before merge if missing)

## SI-002: Fragile Coupling with serving_chat.py via prev_tool_call_arr

**Severity**: MEDIUM

**Title**: Parser uses workaround for serving_chat.py internal state inspection

**Description**:
The Mistral tool parser contains a documented "HACK" (lines 268-274, 504-510) to work around serving_chat.py's inspection of the `prev_tool_call_arr` internal state. This creates fragile coupling where changes to either component could break the other.

**Location**:
- Workaround code: `/Volumes/SourceCode/vllm/trees/20251003-review-pr-19425/vllm/entrypoints/openai/tool_parsers/mistral_tool_parser.py:268-274, 504-510`
- Coupling point: serving_chat.py (not in PR but referenced)

**Evidence**:
```python
# Line 268-274 (and similar at 504-510)
# HACK: serving_chat.py inspects the internal state of tool parsers
# when determining it's final streaming delta, automatically
# adding autocompleted JSON.
# These two lines avoid that nonsense while ensuring finish_reason
# is set to tool_calls when at least one tool is called.
if delta_tool_calls and not self.prev_tool_call_arr:
    self.prev_tool_call_arr = [{"arguments": {}}]
```

From integration-analysis.md:
- Integration type: prev_tool_call_arr (FRAGILE)
- Risk: MEDIUM
- Issue: Workaround documented as "HACK"

**Impact**:
- Future changes to serving_chat.py could break parser
- Unclear contract between parser and serving_chat.py
- Workaround masks underlying architectural issue
- No integration tests validating this interaction

**Root Cause**:
- serving_chat.py inspects `prev_tool_call_arr` to detect tool calls
- Parser must set dummy value to trigger expected behavior
- Unclear why this inspection pattern exists instead of using return values

**Recommendation**:

**Short-term** (this PR):
1. Add integration test validating serving_chat.py interaction:
   ```python
   async def test_serving_chat_integration_with_streaming_tools(client):
       # Test that finish_reason="tool_calls" set correctly
       # Test that serving_chat.py doesn't add unwanted autocomplete JSON
   ```

2. Document the contract in docstring:
   ```python
   def extract_tool_calls_streaming(self, ...):
       """
       ...
       Note: serving_chat.py inspects self.prev_tool_call_arr to determine
       finish_reason. Parser must set non-empty array when tool calls detected.
       """
   ```

**Long-term** (follow-up):
1. Refactor serving_chat.py to use explicit return values instead of internal state
2. Create proper interface contract between parsers and serving layer
3. Remove HACK workaround once serving_chat.py refactored

**Priority**: MEDIUM (works now but fragile)

**pr_addressed**: Workaround implemented, but underlying issue remains
