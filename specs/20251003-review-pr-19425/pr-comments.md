## Substantive Comments

### Comment 1: bot_token Assertion Concern

**Commenter**: bbrowning
**Date**: October 3, 2025
**Type**: CONCERN

**Full Comment**:
> "Can we guarantee that we always see the `bot_token` generated as the single special token?"

**Context**: Assertion in code that `bot_token` appears in `delta_text` as a single token

**Issue**:
- PR contains assertion that bot_token will always appear in a single delta
- Reviewer questions whether this assumption holds across all scenarios
- Different tokenizer versions or streaming patterns might violate this assertion

**Severity if Unresolved**: MEDIUM
**Rationale**: Could cause assertion failures in production if assumption doesn't hold

**Resolution Status**: NEEDS VERIFICATION (T008)
- Check if code was modified to address this concern
- OR check if documented rationale exists for keeping assertion

### Comment 2: Partial JSON Handling Suggestion

**Commenter**: ndebeiss
**Date**: September 2, 2025
**Type**: SUGGESTION

**Full Comment**:
> "not to partial load json until we find a `]` or `}`"

**Context**: Streaming/parsing issues with Mistral Nemo model

**Issue**:
- Observed partial JSON parsing problems during streaming
- Character doubling in streaming responses
- Suggested waiting for complete JSON structure markers before parsing

**Specific Problems Reported**:
- Partial JSON fragments cause parsing errors
- Streaming responses sometimes double characters
- Need more careful boundary detection for JSON structures

**Severity if Unresolved**: MEDIUM
**Rationale**: Affects robustness and correctness of streaming parser

**Resolution Status**: NEEDS VERIFICATION (T008)
- Check if partial JSON handling logic was improved
- OR check if this concern was addressed with documented rationale

### Comment 3: v13 Tokenizer Compatibility Issues

**Commenter**: avigny
**Date**: September 22, 2025
**Type**: CONCERN + QUESTION

**Full Comment Context**:
> Raised compatibility concern with new Magistral/Devstrall models (v13 tokenizer)
> New tool call format differs from previous implementations
> Seeking guidance on whether to expand current PR or create separate PR for new model support

**Issue**:
- Newer Mistral models (Magistral/Devstrall) use v13 tokenizer
- v13 tokenizer has different tool call format than pre-v11 and v11
- Current PR may not support v13 models

**Specific Concerns**:
- Tool call format incompatibility with v13
- Question of scope: should this PR handle v13 or separate PR?
- Potential need for additional parsing logic for new format

**Severity if Unresolved**: HIGH
**Rationale**: Newer Mistral models may not work with this fix

**Resolution Status**: NEEDS VERIFICATION (T008)
- Check if v13 support was added to this PR
- OR check if decision documented to defer v13 to separate PR
- OR check if v13 is explicitly out of scope with rationale

### Comment 4: Mistral Small 3.2 Parsing Failures

**Commenter**: PedroMiolaSilva
**Date**: July 2, 2025
**Type**: BUG REPORT

**Full Comment Context**:
> Reported tool call parsing failures with Mistral Small 3.2
> Provided specific error traces and reproduction steps
> Suggested potential parsing modifications

**Issue**:
- Streaming tool calls completely failing for Mistral Small 3.2
- Specific error traces provided (details to be examined in code)
- One of the three critical issues PR is meant to fix

**Specific Problems**:
- Complete failure of streaming tool call functionality
- Model-specific parsing issues
- Reproducible error scenario

**Severity**: CRITICAL
**Rationale**: Complete feature failure for specific model (Issue #20028)

**Resolution Status**: SHOULD BE FIXED IN PR
- This is one of the three linked issues
- Test coverage MUST exist for this (verify in T006)
- If not fixed, would be major gap

## Analysis Requirements (T008)

For each comment, T008 must determine:

1. **Comment 1 (bot_token)**:
   - addressed_in_pr: Check if code was modified
   - has_documented_rationale: Check PR discussion for rationale

2. **Comment 2 (partial JSON)**:
   - addressed_in_pr: Check if parsing logic improved
   - has_documented_rationale: Check for design rationale

3. **Comment 3 (v13)**:
   - addressed_in_pr: Check if v13 support added
   - has_documented_rationale: Check if scope decision documented

4. **Comment 4 (Mistral Small 3.2)**:
   - addressed_in_pr: MUST be fixed (linked issue)
   - Test coverage required in T006

---

## Additional Context

**Common Themes**:
- Streaming robustness is a recurring concern
- Tokenizer version differences create compatibility challenges
- JSON parsing during streaming has multiple edge cases

**Technical Challenges Highlighted**:
- State management during incremental JSON parsing
- Token boundary detection in streaming context
- Model-specific format variations
