# Tasks: PR #19425 Review - Mistral Tool Parser Streaming

**Input**: Design documents from `/Volumes/SourceCode/vllm/trees/20251003-review-pr-19425/specs/20251003-review-pr-19425/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md, contracts/review-analysis-schema.json

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Tech stack: Python 3.10+, vLLM core, pytest, ijson/custom parser, Mistral tokenizers
   → Review scope: PR #19425 + entire streaming/parsing subsystem
2. Load design documents:
   → data-model.md: 10 entities (ReviewFindings, Finding, FileAnalysis, TestCoverage, etc.)
   → quickstart.md: 10 review execution steps
   → contracts/review-analysis-schema.json: JSON schema for findings
3. Generate tasks following quickstart workflow:
   → Discovery → Analysis → Finding Generation → Documentation
4. Apply review-specific rules:
   → No code implementation tasks (analysis only)
   → Discovery tasks can be parallel [P]
   → Analysis tasks sequential (build on each other)
   → Finding generation after all analysis complete
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Validate against functional requirements FR-001 through FR-011
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
